        <p>Bronze statue of Joshua Nkomo, 'Father Zimbabwe', located at the intersection of Joshua Nkomo Street and 8th Avenue in Bulawayo. Unveiled on Unity Day in 2013, 14 years after his passing, it symbolizes Zimbabwe's shift from colonial to post-colonial commemoration and honors Nkomo's pivotal role in the country's liberation and peace efforts.</p>
